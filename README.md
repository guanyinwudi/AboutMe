**Programming**
I have learned several programming languages in class,

- Python
- HTML/JavaScript
1. Using Python, I tried the turtle library to perform image processing, as shown in [TurtleImage](https://github.com/guanyinwudi/AboutMe/src)
2. Using SVG, I wrote a picture generated by texteditor. What an amazing experience!
